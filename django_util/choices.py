"""Django choice field definitions for various data types.

This module provides a collection of choice classes for use with Django models and forms.
Each class inherits from BaseChoices and provides standardized options for different
data types and business domains.

Categories:
    - Generic: Basic choice types like boolean, time frequency, etc.
    - Person: Demographic and personal information choices
    - Payment: Payment and transaction related choices

Example:
    from django_util.choices import TimeFrequencyChoices

    class Subscription(models.Model):
        frequency = models.CharField(
            max_length=50,
            choices=TimeFrequencyChoices.choices,
            default=TimeFrequencyChoices.DEFAULT
        )
